<h3>lore yap..</h3>

Context : Azure Wasteland is one of the 3 stories i've always wanted to tell for a few years now. The trilogy is about the
cycle of ancestral sin, How it passes through culture, connections, and habits. It follows humanity's
(and by extension, other future races/species) struggle with temptation, consequence, and salvation.<br><br>

It takes many inspirations from The Bible, but I plan on not sacralizing everything so that the messages I want to show reaches
to all audiences, I want the vibe to lean towards having good morals as a human being instead of being another "reinterpreted religious story".<br><br>

Anywho, Azure Wasteland follows Azzurra and a few others adventure where they must seek redemption / salvation and fight to (try) and break the cycle of sin
that plagued the world. It's set in a Lush, Apocalyptic Wasteland where the world is warped and has evolved far beyond when humans walked the earth.
