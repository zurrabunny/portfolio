<h3>1. What tools do you usually use?</h3>

I mostly use Clip Studio Paint when drawing, making graphics, and animating. Its my go-to program to do everything illustration related :]

I specialize in rough animation and storyboarding, but i can handle clean up animation and coloring! Im really adaptable when it comes to Animation

<h3>3. How long have you been creating art?</h3>

Ive been creating digital art since 2019, my art skills really skyrocketed when I enrolled in CIIT for senior high! :o)

<h3>4. What inspires your style?</h3>

I get inspired by art on pinterest, especially the ones that look hand-painted. I really like cute, painterly styles and i use that technique very often, especially when illustrating backgrounds :]

<h3>5. Are you open for commissions or collaborations?</h3>

I dont take commissions that often, I am open to art trades though! I am very open to collaborations as well! it depends on what the collaboration is about, if you believe my work is a good fit for the job, please don’t hesitate to contact me!

<h3>6. What projects are you currently working on?</h3>

Im currently working with the folks on <a href="https://x.com/RainworldMC">Rainworld MC</a>, making 3D models of creatures and machines, as well as animating them.

<h3>7. Do you only do animation work or do you work in other fields too?</h3>

My main plans (shown on my Growth and Goals tab) focus on Animation and Illustration, since thats what I want to do for my career. But I dont mind stepping outside that path for side work. One thing Im proud of is how adaptable I am, I can handle tasks even outside my main skills. Im basically a “jack-of-all-trades” type of person :]
