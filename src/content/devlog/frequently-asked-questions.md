<details>
  <summary>4. What inspires your style?</summary>

  <summary>6. What projects are you currently working on?</summary>
  <p>Im currently working with the folks on <a href="https://x.com/RainworldMC">Rainworld MC</a>, making 3D models of creatures and machines, as well as animating them.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>7. Do you only do animation work or do you work in other fields too?</summary>
  <p>My main plans focus on Animation and Illustration, since thats what I want to do for my career. But Im really adaptable and can handle tasks outside my main skills too. kinda like a "jack-of-all-trades" :]</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>8. What’s your workflow like?</summary>
  <p>Since I do a lot of things, I've categorized them into their own tab below :o)</p>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Illustration</summary>
  <p>For illustration, i type out my ideas first in a temporary .txt file.<br><br>
  Then i go to Pinterest to find pose references, color palettes, and everything else i need to visualize it better.<br><br>
  I sketch things out in Clip Studio Paint, I do the linework (either on bitmap or vector layers), then i color with
  my brush :o)<br><br>
  Thats about it</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Animation</summary>
  <p>For animation, i type out my ideas first in a temporary .txt file.<br><br>
  Then i go to Pinterest to find pose references, color palettes, and everything else i need to visualize it better.<br><br>
  I sketch out the rough poses, sketch out the inbetweens, correct the frame timing, and i refine it all by drawing slightly cleaner frames layered ontop of the sketch<br><br>
  Then i do the linework in a vector layer, then i color it in a different layer. I also draw color lines in a vector layer to make sure the shadows and highlights move smoothly.<br><br>
  If i want to make an animated video, i export the animation as a PNG sequence, drag it all to Davinci Resolve, tweak the animation speed, and export it as a video.<br><br>
  Then i drag the video to FL Studio and do the sound editing there. after that, i drag the audio to Davinci Resolve and export it again as a video<br><br>
  Thats about it</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>3D</summary>
  <p>For 3D, i type out my ideas first in a temporary .txt file.<br><br>
  Then i go to Pinterest to find pose references, color palettes, and everything else i need to visualize it better.<br><br>
  I make a rough sketch of an object from all lateral perspectives, i color it in, then drag it to Blender.<br><br>
  I trace the sketch using vertices from all angles, then i add faces on it afterwards, i tweak the shape to better match the reference sketch i made<br><br>
  Then i set up the color materials, shaders, etc.<br><br>
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Storyboard</summary>
  <p>For Storyboard, i draw tiny squares on a canvas and sketch out the scenes like a little comic strip, then i make a palette for each scene and color it in<br><br>
  For a 2D storyboard, i mainly use Clip Studio Paint. i usually just make a cleaner sketch of all the scenes and time them properly, I export it from Clip Studio Paint as a video and drag it to FL Studio for sound editing.<br><br>
  For a 2.5D storyboard (its usually 3D background with 2D elements), i utilize blender's grease pencil. I model the key background features, then i make objects that i can use to move each grease pencil element along the background.</p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Music</summary>
  <p>There's no specific workflow i follow to make music, I kinda just go with the flow.<br><br>
  I do take a lot of inspiration from the music i listen to, as well as download project files that suit my needs + get the samples from.
  </p>
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary>Website Coding</summary>
  <p>Whenever i code a website, i usually add colored squares to a screen, sometimes with placeholder text until im contented with the layout<br><br>
  Then i decorate it with fonts, animations, visual candy (buttons highlighting when you hover over them)<br><br>
  Thats about it for the important stuff, JavaScript is kinda its own thing to explain, Im not smart enough to explain it.</p>
  </details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>9. What programs do you use for music and sound?</summary>
  <p>FL Studio! all of the sounds and music i make, as well as the sound effects i add in my videos came from FL Studio.<br><br>
  I personally think its a versatile tool for me, especially with how spacious its timeline is. makes it easy for me to process things.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>10. Can people contact you for school or research interviews?</summary>
  <p>Hell yeah! I like talking about myself infront of *small* groups of people, just contant me through discord / email me (preferrably both) if you want to interview me!</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>11. How do you handle deadlines?</summary>
  <p>As a partial workaholic, I really fixate on getting things done (mostly with solo work). I dont play games that often, so i have a lot of free time working on a task.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>12. What do you enjoy most about creating?</summary>
  <p>What i enjoy most about creating things is that you get to put your own twist into it! I dont really follow conventional themes, especially for music. It makes it unique because it has a bit of you mixed in to it :]</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>13. Do you take feedback well?</summary>
  <p>Yeah! Constructive criticism is key! I ask for feedback very often when i can, it's how i improve.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>14. What’s your dream project?</summary>
  <p>Hopefully when i get enough experience (possibly more people that i can work with), I get to make an animated series! :D<br><br>
  Theres this one story i've always wanted to tell for a few years now. Its a trilogy about the cycle of ancestral sin, How it passes through culture, connections, and habits. It follows humanity's
  (and by extension, other future races/species) struggle with temptation, consequence, and salvation.<br><br>

  It takes many inspirations from The Bible, but I plan on not sacralizing everything so that the messages I want to show reaches
  to all audiences, I want the vibe to lean towards having good morals as a human being instead of being another "reinterpreted religious story".</p>
