<p>The concept of choosing the perfect path to get the perfect life has made me struggle a lot. I've been meaning to be an Engineer, an Astronaut, a Lawyer, or a Doctor in my youth, because those are what people think are perfect. A perfect job with a 6-figure salary. I’ve been meaning to get into sports, technology, and culinary arts because that's what people think are perfect, the perfect talent that can lead to a lot of opportunities.<br><br>
Yet I'm here, a starving artist learning how to improve my drawing skills in an art school with other students in a similar situation. Would people think taking this path in our lives would be a waste? I've heard horror stories of artists taking 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet because the demand for art has been overtaken by soulless machines. It sounds very dystopian the way I worded it doesn't it?<br><br>
I also find it funny that the people that use these soulless machines treat them with empathy because the art they produce isn't perfect and the excuse they always think of when that happens is that “Oh, they’re just learning, it will improve overtime”. But yet those same people have been bashing on artists that are more capable of bringing their vision to life for years now, telling them that they’ve wasted their lives pursuing art while they can just learn hard to get the perfect job with a 6-figure salary, learn the perfect talent that can lead to a lot of opportunities, pushing them to what they think on how to win in life.<br><br>
The concept of choosing the perfect path to get the perfect life has made me struggle a lot, and I'm sure a lot of artists think the same way too. Taking an art degree is guaranteed to give you the same subjectivity art pieces also give to the audience. People might be fond of it, people might be against it, you might bring people together, you might offend people. But it's also guaranteed to give you the same benefits those same pieces gave to the world. Art can captivate people with its simplicity or complexity, Art can inspire others and fuel their ability to imagine, Art makes people aware and discover, Art makes people find themselves, Art can create, destroy, and conquer.<br><br>
Even after all that, you created an identity for yourself through art, you've destroyed the idea of the perfect path in favour of what you truly want, you've conquered all that tried to stop you from pursuing your artistry. You still think it's a mistake? Do you still have those same doubts? Not all paths are created equal, not all people are built equally to handle what's yet to come. Not all art is perfect, You are not perfect. The world admires art despite its imperfections, whether they notice it or not, what’s stopping the world from admiring you?<br><br>
You are an art piece, Imperfections and all.</p>
