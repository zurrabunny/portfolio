<h3>storytime >:]</h3>

It's really easy for me to make a static-looking website where all of the text and data you'd need
to know about me are already displayed in front of you without any intervention, but I know to myself that
reading a bunch of words on a screen can be a chore sometimes, especially when it isn't accompanied with
visuals and diagrams and all that.<br><br>

So I decided to challenge myself (and to aid myself) by making this website as visually informative as I can, filled with
dropdown menus, image tags, website tabs, and (my personal favourite) the Goal Map I used for my "Growth and Goals" tab.<br><br>

I have ADHD, and it affects how I interpret information in front of me. BIG, LONG texts are always my weakness (unless I myself typed them out).
So I've spent more than 2 weeks putting everything I've mentioned above into reality. The most complex ones (the Goal Map) took at least 3 days of
non-stop coding and testing, making sure it works on both PC and mobile..<br><br>

I am thankful that I managed to push through all of those obstacles. I do get a very clean layout of who I am in return. This website
almost embodies who I truly am, and I really think that's neat :]<br><br>

The other website makers I've tried are either visually messy (unwanted visuals / watermarks) or functionally limiting, and if I
really want to express who I am and what I'm like, it's best that I do that from scratch.
